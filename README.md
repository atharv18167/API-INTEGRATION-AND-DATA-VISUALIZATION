##The Weather Data Visualization task was designed to help me understand how real-time data can be fetched from the internet using a public API and then processed and visualized using Python. In this task, I worked with the OpenWeatherMap public API, which provides weather-related information such as temperature, humidity, and forecast data for different cities. The main objective of this task was to learn how to interact with external APIs, handle JSON data, and present the extracted information in the form of meaningful visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This task also introduced me to the concept of creating a simple visualization dashboard, which is an important skill in data analysis and software development.

In this project, I first learned what an API (Application Programming Interface) is and how it allows different software applications to communicate with each other. I understood that an API acts as a bridge between my Python program and an external service, in this case, a weather service. I learned how to create an account on OpenWeatherMap and generate an API key, which is required to authenticate requests. I also learned that API keys are sensitive and must be handled carefully, as they identify the user making the request. Through this task, I realized that without a valid and active API key, the API does not return the expected data, which helped me understand real-world authentication and authorization concepts.

After obtaining the API key, I implemented Python code to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library. I learned how to construct a URL with query parameters such as city name, API key, and units of measurement. The API response was returned in JSON format, which is a commonly used data format for web services. I learned how to convert this JSON response into a Python dictionary and how to extract useful information from it. Specifically, I worked with forecast data that contains multiple time-based weather records, including temperature and humidity values.

Once the data was extracted, I implemented data processing using the Pandas library. I created lists to store dates, temperature values, and humidity values, and then converted these lists into a structured DataFrame. This step helped me understand how raw data can be organized into a tabular format, making it easier to analyze and visualize. I also learned the importance of checking API responses before using them, as sometimes the API may return an error message instead of the expected data.

For data visualization, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create line graphs that show temperature and humidity trends over time. I learned how visualizations make data easier to understand compared to raw numbers. By plotting temperature and humidity against time, I was able to observe changes in weather patterns clearly. I also learned how to customize graphs by adding titles, labels, and rotating axis values to improve readability.

In addition to static visualizations, I implemented a simple visualization dashboard using Streamlit. This dashboard allows the user to enter a city name and view the corresponding weather trends interactively. Through this, I learned the basics of building user-friendly interfaces for data applications and how Python can be used not only for scripting but also for creating simple web-based dashboards. This part of the task helped me understand how data analysis and presentation go hand in hand in real-world applications.

Overall, this task helped me gain practical experience in API integration, data handling, error handling, data visualization, and dashboard creation using Python. I learned how real-time data is fetched, processed, and displayed in a structured and meaningful way. This project strengthened my understanding of Python libraries, improved my problem-solving skills, and gave me confidence to work with real-world data. The knowledge gained from this task is highly useful for future projects related to data analysis, software development, and web-based applications.
